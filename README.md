# Customer-Segmentation

Customer Segmentation using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm using various libraries on Python.

<u> What is Customer Segmentation?</u>

Simply put, it is the practice of categorizing consumers into groups based on shared qualities so that the business may sell to each group effectively and efficiently.

<u> Unsupervised learning?</u>

It is the kind of machine learning in which the training data is supplied to the algorithm without any pre-assigned labels or scores. Thus, it must, as a result, first self-discover any naturally existing patterns in the training dataset.

<u> K-means? </u> 

It's a clustering method that aims to partition the n observations into k clusters in which, each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest "mean".

## Project's outline

1. Import of the required libraries.
2. Import of the data.
3. Data Pre-Processing and analysis.
4. Identifying the number of clusters in the data.
5. Training the model.
6. Visualize the different clusters in the data.
